# That-Game
(That Game) Is original and is not realted to magic the gathering, yugioh, duel masters, the pokemon, gambling, and cardfight vanguard. the is simple to learn but hard to master. the gmae is only inspired by game mechanics used in any game that used cards but is not based apon the pictures and names of what those cards do, this game believe it or not came out of sheer bordum and was an orginal idea with inspiration form another games mechanics.
