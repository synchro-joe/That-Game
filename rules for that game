(these two rules are Linked)

When you use the equaliser rule you can use the cards from the remove from game zone to help activate the 
5 card rule but you need to have cards already used from the equaliser to bring out resources and 
( example, if you have 2 spades in your hand and 3 in the remove from game zone you can put the two spades in your hand 
and use the 5 card rule and 5 card rules still apply.


Domination
Once per turn you can send  back to the deck  2 cards of your choice and take two cards of your choice, 
but of the (same suit) such as diamonds and place in your hand the cards chosen and shuffle, your deck. 
( both players are allowed to do this once per turn.)
